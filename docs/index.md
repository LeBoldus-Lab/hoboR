# Welcome to HOBOR: 
 
  **A package for the analysis of weather station data.** HoboR is a specialized R package designed to streamline the processing of large datasets from HOBO weather stations and data loggers. With HoboR, handling .csv files generated by a variety of HOBO models becomes effortless. This package analyzes diverse weather measurements such as temperature, relative humidity (RH), dew point, and light intensity. Additionally, HoboR is versatile in accepting data in multiple date formats, including *Day/Month/Year* (DD/MM/YYYY), *Month/Day/Year* (MM/DD/YYYY), and two digits *Year/Month/Day* (YY/MM/DD), ensuring flexibility across global time formats.

    Analyzing weather station data collected over a brief period can quickly become a big data project, making the task of processing and analysis a significant challenge. To facilitate the analysis and manipulation of weather station data, we developed HoboR. We aim to simplify this process, making it less time-consuming for researchers and users of weather data. HoboR offers a series of tools to load all CSV files, remove duplicates, and provide summary statistics for downstream and complex analyses or just summarizing weather data.
