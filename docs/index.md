# Welcome to HOBOR: 
 
  **A package for the analysis of weather station data.** HoboR is a specialized R package designed to streamline the processing of large datasets from HOBO weather stations and data loggers. With HoboR, handling .csv files generated by a variety of HOBO models becomes effortless. This package analyzes diverse weather measurements such as temperature, relative humidity (RH), dew point, and light intensity. Additionally, HoboR is versatile in accepting data in multiple date formats, including *Day/Month/Year* (DD/MM/YYYY), *Month/Day/Year* (MM/DD/YYYY), and two digits *Year/Month/Day* (YY/MM/DD), ensuring flexibility across global time formats.

    Analyzing weather station data collected over a brief period can quickly become a big data project, making the task of processing and analysis a significant challenge. To facilitate the analysis and manipulation of weather station data, we developed HoboR. We aim to simplify this process, making it less time-consuming for researchers and users of weather data. HoboR offers a series of tools to load all CSV files, remove duplicates, and provide summary statistics for downstream and complex analyses or just summarizing weather data.

## How to Install HOBOR

`HOBOR` installation via `devtools`, and in the process of submit it to CRAN. 

First, install `devtools` and dependency libraries
```R
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
 devtools::install_github("LeBoldus-Lab/hoboR", force = TRUE)
library(hoboR)
```
Recommended dependencies

```R
library(lubridate)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
```

## How to use HOBO

#### For readers
Hobor is an R package to process CSV files from HOBO weather stations and data loggers. The best way to start your project with hobor, is to organize your CSV files from a single directory for `hobobinder()` function to process all the CSV files. E.g., if you have 10 locations, you should have 10 folders, and each folder containing all the CSV corresponding to your period of time. By having all the files in a single data frame, hobocleaner() can sort all the entries and identify duplicates generated while retrieving the data or replacing batteries. In addition, the hobomean() function summarize the data by time intervals of your election. 

Other functions to identify impossible values and sensor failures are available. As well as subsetting function by time intervals such as ho.range() or snapshots of a time intervals using timestamp(). Additional code is provided to calibrate HOBO data loggers, and experimental analysis of diseases incidence related to sudden oak death.

#### For coders

```R
# load the library
library(hoboR)
```

### Example
Suppose multiple CSV files in a directory called site A. 

```R
# Change the number for the site
site = "A"
# Add the PATH to your sites for weather data (from hobo)
path = paste0("path/your//site_", site)
# make sure the path to your CSV files exists
file.exists(path)        # this will return a logical value TRUE
```

All the CSV from site A are merged with `hobinder()`, note that some HOBO files format are different. 
Inspect you file, and choose how many rows you need to skip to read the columns.
```R
# loading all hobo files
hobofiles <- hobinder(path, skip=1)
```
After merging, the hobocleaner function adjusts to differet datasets, clean duplicate entries, and rename columns. The format argument should match the HOBO format type: "ymd" for YYYY/MM/DD, "myd" for MM/YYYY/DD", and "yymd" corresponds to two digits year YY/MM/DD. Be mindful with your format selection, otherwise proceed with caution.
```R
# cleaning hobo files, add format
hobocleaned <- hobocleaner(hobofiles, format = "ymd")
head(hobocleaned)
tail(hobocleaned)
```
The clean data can be aggregated by time interval, e.g. "5 mins", "12 h", "1 day", etc., by using hobotime(), or obtaining the mean, the minimum and maximum, and the rest of summary statistcs by implementing meanhobo().

```R
# getting hobo mean summary by time
hobot <- hobotime(hobocleaned, summariseby = "5 mins", na.rm = T)
head(hobot)

# getting hobo means by date
hobomeans <- meanhobo(hobocleaned, summariseby = "1 day",  na.rm = T)
head(hobomeans)
```

### Additional features

```
# Specify a window range 
horange(hobocleaned, start="2022-06-04", end="2022-10-22")

# Snapshot of a time interval 
timestamp(hobocleaned, stamp = "2022-08-05 00:01", by = "24 hours",
          days = 100, na.rm = TRUE, plot = T, var = "Temp")

# Obtain the maximum and minimum values
impossiblevalues(hobocleaned, showrows = 3)

# Identify sensor failures
na_data <- NAsensorfailures(hobocleaned, condition = ">", threshold = c(50, 3000, 101), opt = c("Temp", "Rain", "Wetness"))
```


### Get plots  

Here, I provide a guide to `ggplot` the weather data, for one and two variables. This way you have more control about the style, color and format of your data. 

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)

# Plot one variable: temperateure
ggplot(hobocleaned, aes(x=as.POSIXct(Date), y = Temp)) +
  geom_line(alpha= 0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous( name = "Temperature °C")+
  ggtitle("Temperature: Oct 14 - Nov 11, 2021")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_x_datetime(labels = date_format("%Y-%m-%d"))+
  theme_bw()

# two vars
ggplot(hobocleaned, aes(x=as.POSIXct(Date))) +
  geom_line( aes(y=Temp, col = "red"), alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_line( aes(y= Wetness, col = "blue"), alpha = 0.5) + 
  scale_y_continuous(
    # Features of the first axis
    name = "Temperature °C",
    # Add a second axis and specify its features
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~., name="Humidity")
  ) +
  labs(title = "Temperature: Oct 14 - Nov 11, 2021", color = "Legend") +
  scale_color_manual(labels = c("Humidity", "Temp"), values = c("blue", "red")) +
  scale_x_datetime(labels = date_format("%Y-%m-%d"))+
  theme_bw()
```

There is a function to analyze the correlation between the weather variables
```R
# horrelation
horrelation(hobocleaned, summariseby = "month", by = "mean", na.rm = F)
```
